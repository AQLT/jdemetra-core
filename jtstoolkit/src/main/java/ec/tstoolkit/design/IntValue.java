/**
 * Defines a class that can be represented by an int.<br>
 * This int can be just a sequence or have a special meaning. 
 * It is often used to convert an enum to an int.<br>
 * Be aware that there is no point in comparing two ints from two different classes.
 * For example, <code>Frequency.intValue() > Gender.intValue()</code> 
 * would compile and give a result but would not have a real meaning.
 * Also note that this class should have a constructor or a factory that uses an 
 * int as sole parameter. For example, <code>Frequency.valueOf(int)</code>.
