 * also be used to convert a String to a new one.<br> The parser must not throw
 * Exceptions; it must swallow it and return {@code null}. This means that
 * {@code null} is not considered has a value (same as Collection API). To
 * create a "null value" from a parser, you should use the NullObject pattern.
