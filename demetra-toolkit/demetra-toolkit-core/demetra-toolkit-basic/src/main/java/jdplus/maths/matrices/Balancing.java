/**
 * This class corresponds to the Lapack routine DGEBAL. DGEBAL balances a
 * general real matrix A. This involves, first, permuting A by a similarity
 * transformation to isolate eigenvalues in the first 0 to LOW (excluded) and
 * last HIGH to N (excluded) elements on the diagonal and second, applying a
 * diagonal similarity transformation to rows and columns LOW to HIGH (excluded)
 * to make the rows and columns as close in norm as possible. Both steps are
 * optional.
 *
 * Balancing may reduce the 1-norm of the matrix, and improve the accuracy of
 * the computed eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors.
