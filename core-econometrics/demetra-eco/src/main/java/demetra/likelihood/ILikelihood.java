/**
 * The ILikelihood interface formalizes the likelihood of a usual
 * gaussian model. We suppose that the scaling factor is part of the parameters
 * and that it is concentrated out of the likelihood  
 * <br>
 * For a N(0, sig2*V) distribution (dim = n), the log-likelihood is given by
 * <br>
 * -.5*[n*log(2*pi)+log(det(V)*sig2^n)+(1/sig2)*y'(V^-1)y].
 * <br>
 * If we factorize V as LL' (L is the Cholesky factor of V) and if we write e=L^-1*y, we get
 * <br>
 * ll=-.5*[n*log(2*pi)+log(det(V))+n*log(sig2)+(1/sig2)*e'e]
 * <br>
 * To be noted that det(V) is then the square of the product of the main diagonal of L.
 * <br>
 * The ML estimator of sig2 is given by sig2=e'e/n
 * <br>
 * If we concentrate it out of the likelihood, we get:
 * <br>
 * ll=-.5[n*log(2*pi)+n*(log(ssq/n)+1)+ldet]
 * <br>
 * So, the likelihood is defined by means of:
 * <br> - n = dim() 
 * <br> - ldet = logDeterminant() 
 * <br> - ssq = ssq() 
 * <br> -sig2 =ssq/n is given by sigma()
 * <br>
 * Maximizing the concentrated likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the function:
 * <br>
 * ssq * det^1/n (= ssq*factor)
 * <br>
 * if e are the residuals and v = e*det^1/(2n), we try to minimize the sum of squares defined by vv'.
 * This last formulation will be used in optimization procedures based like Levenberg-Marquardt or similar algorithms.
